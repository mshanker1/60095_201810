```{r}
#install.packages("forecast")

```

```{r}
Amtrak.data <- read.csv("Amtrak.csv")
Amtrak.data
```
# create time series object using ts()
# ts() takes three arguments: start, end, and freq. 
# with monthly data, the frequency of periods per season is 12 (per year). 
# arguments start and end are (season number, period number) pairs. 
# here start is Jan 1991: start = c(1991, 1); end is Mar 2004: end = c(2004, 3).
```{r}
ridership.ts <- ts(Amtrak.data$Ridership, 
    start = c(1991, 1), end = c(2004, 3), freq = 12)
plot(ridership.ts, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Ridership (in 000s)", ylim = c(1300, 2300))
```
# create short time series
# use window() to create a new, shorter time series of ridership.ts
# for the new three-year series, start time is Jan 1997 and end time is Dec 1999
```{r}
ridership.ts.3yrs <- window(ridership.ts, start = c(1997, 1), end = c(1999, 12))
```
# fit a linear regression model to the time series
```{r}
library(forecast)
ridership.lm <- tslm(ridership.ts ~ trend + I(trend^2))
```
# shorter and longer time series

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
plot(ridership.ts.3yrs, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Ridership (in 000s)", 
                        ylim = c(1300, 2300))
plot(ridership.ts, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Ridership (in 000s)", ylim = c(1300, 2300))
# overlay the fitted values of the linear model
lines(ridership.lm$fitted, lwd = 1)

```
Now we do Naive forecasts
First split the data into training and validation
```{r}
nValid <- 36
nTrain <- length(ridership.ts) - nValid
# partition the data
train.ts <- window(ridership.ts, start = c(1991, 1), end = c(1991, nTrain))
valid.ts <- window(ridership.ts, start = c(1991, nTrain + 1),
                   end = c(1991, nTrain + nValid))
 
```

```{r}
#  generate the naive and seasonal naive forecasts
naive.pred <- forecast::naive(train.ts, h = nValid)
snaive.pred <- forecast::snaive(train.ts, h = nValid)
```

```{r}
# plot forecasts and actuals in the training and validation sets
plot(train.ts, ylim = c(1300, 2600),  ylab = "Ridership", xlab = "Time", bty = "l", 
    xaxt = "n", xlim = c(1991,2006.25), main = "") 
axis(1, at = seq(1991, 2006, 1), labels = format(seq(1991, 2006, 1)))
lines(naive.pred$mean, lwd = 2, col = "blue", lty = 1)
lines(snaive.pred$mean, lwd = 2, col = "red", lty = 1)
lines(valid.ts, col = "grey20", lty = 3)
lines(c(2004.25 - 3, 2004.25 - 3), c(0, 3500)) 
lines(c(2004.25, 2004.25), c(0, 3500))
text(1996.25, 2500, "Training")
text(2002.75, 2500, "Validation")
text(2005.25, 2500, "Future")
arrows(2004 - 3, 2450, 1991.25, 2450, code = 3, length = 0.1, lwd = 1,angle = 30)
arrows(2004.5 - 3, 2450, 2004, 2450, code = 3, length = 0.1, lwd = 1,angle = 30)
arrows(2004.5, 2450, 2006, 2450, code = 3, length = 0.1, lwd = 1, angle = 30)
```

```{r}
forecast::accuracy(naive.pred, valid.ts)
forecast::accuracy(snaive.pred, valid.ts)
```

Now, let us model the time series using regression models
Linear Trend
```{r}
library(forecast)

#Amtrak.data <- read.csv("Amtrak.csv")

# create time series

ridership.ts <- ts(Amtrak.data$Ridership, start = c(1991,1),
                   end = c(2004,3), freq = 12)

# produce linear trend model
ridership.lm <- tslm(ridership.ts ~ trend)

# plot the series
plot(ridership.ts, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Ridership", ylim = c(1300,2300),
     bty = "l")
lines(ridership.lm$fitted, lwd = 2)
```

Now, run the model using validation and training sets
```{r}
# fit linear trend model to training set and create forecasts
train.lm <- tslm(train.ts ~ trend)
train.lm.pred <- forecast(train.lm, h = nValid, level = 0)

par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
plot(train.lm.pred, ylim = c(1300, 2600),  ylab = "Ridership", xlab = "Time", 
     bty = "l", xaxt = "n", xlim = c(1991,2006.25), main = "", flty = 2)
axis(1, at = seq(1991, 2006, 1), labels = format(seq(1991, 2006, 1)))
lines(train.lm.pred$fitted, lwd = 2, col = "blue")
lines(valid.ts)
plot(train.lm.pred$residuals, ylim = c(-420, 500),  ylab = "Forecast Errors", 
    xlab = "Time", bty = "l", xaxt = "n", xlim = c(1991,2006.25), main = "")
axis(1, at = seq(1991, 2006, 1), labels = format(seq(1991, 2006, 1)))
lines(valid.ts - train.lm.pred$mean, lwd = 1)
```
Summmary
```{r}
summary(train.lm)
```

Now, let's fit an exponential trend
```{r}
# fit exponential trend using tslm() with argument lambda = 0 
train.lm.expo.trend <- tslm(train.ts ~ trend, lambda = 0)
train.lm.expo.trend.pred <- forecast(train.lm.expo.trend, h = nValid, level = 0)

# fit linear trend using tslm() with argument lambda = 1 (no transform of y)
train.lm.linear.trend <- tslm(train.ts ~ trend, lambda = 1)
train.lm.linear.trend.pred <- forecast(train.lm.linear.trend, h = nValid, level = 0)

plot(train.lm.expo.trend.pred, ylim = c(1300, 2600),  ylab = "Ridership", 
 xlab = "Time", bty = "l", xaxt = "n", xlim = c(1991,2006.25), main = "", flty = 2)
axis(1, at = seq(1991, 2006, 1), labels = format(seq(1991, 2006, 1)))
lines(train.lm.expo.trend.pred$fitted, lwd = 2, col = "blue")  # Added in 6-5
lines(train.lm.linear.trend.pred$fitted, lwd = 2, col = "black", lty = 3)
lines(train.lm.linear.trend.pred$mean, lwd = 2, col = "black", lty = 3)
lines(valid.ts)
```

Now, fit a quadratic trend
```{r}
#fit quadratic trend using function I(), which treats an object "as is".
train.lm.poly.trend <- tslm(train.ts ~ trend + I(trend^2))
summary(train.lm.poly.trend)
train.lm.poly.trend.pred <- forecast(train.lm.poly.trend, h = nValid, level = 0)

par(mfrow = c(2,1))
plot(train.lm.poly.trend.pred, ylim = c(1300, 2600),  ylab = "Ridership", 
 xlab = "Time", bty = "l", xaxt = "n", xlim = c(1991,2006.25), main = "", flty = 2)
axis(1, at = seq(1991, 2006, 1), labels = format(seq(1991, 2006, 1))) 
lines(train.lm.poly.trend$fitted, lwd = 2)
lines(valid.ts)

plot(train.lm.poly.trend$residuals, ylim = c(-400, 550),  ylab = "Forecast Errors", 
 xlab = "Time", bty = "l", xaxt = "n", xlim = c(1991,2006.25), main = "")
axis(1, at = seq(1991, 2006, 1), labels = format(seq(1991, 2006, 1)))
lines(valid.ts - train.lm.poly.trend.pred$mean, lwd = 1)
```

Now, let us add seasonality
Our new file has a column called Season
```{r}
AmtrakTS.data <- read.csv("AmtrakTS.csv")
AmtrakTS.data

```
First split the data into training and validation
```{r}
ridership.ts <- ts(AmtrakTS.data$Ridership, 
    start = c(1991, 1), end = c(2004, 3), freq = 12)
nValid <- 36
nTrain <- length(ridership.ts) - nValid
# partition the data
train.ts <- window(ridership.ts, start = c(1991, 1), end = c(1991, nTrain))
valid.ts <- window(ridership.ts, start = c(1991, nTrain + 1),
                   end = c(1991, nTrain + nValid))
```

# include season as a predictor in tslm(). Here it creates 11 dummies
```{r}
train.lm.season <- tslm(train.ts ~ season)
summary(train.lm.season)
```

Now add trend to the season data
```{r}
train.lm.trend.season <- tslm(train.ts ~ trend + I(trend^2) + season)
summary(train.lm.trend.season)
train.lm.trend.season.pred <- forecast(train.lm.trend.season, h = nValid, level = 0)

par(mfrow = c(2,1))
plot(train.lm.trend.season.pred, ylim = c(1300, 2600),  ylab = "Ridership", 
 xlab = "Time", bty = "l", xaxt = "n", xlim = c(1991,2006.25), main = "", flty = 2)
axis(1, at = seq(1991, 2006, 1), labels = format(seq(1991, 2006, 1))) 
lines(train.lm.trend.season$fitted, lwd = 2)
lines(valid.ts)

plot(train.lm.trend.season$residuals, ylim = c(-400, 550),  ylab = "Forecast Errors", 
 xlab = "Time", bty = "l", xaxt = "n", xlim = c(1991,2006.25), main = "")
axis(1, at = seq(1991, 2006, 1), labels = format(seq(1991, 2006, 1)))
lines(valid.ts - train.lm.trend.season.pred$mean, lwd = 1, col="red")
```
Now let's calculate the autocorrelation
```{r}
ridership.24.ts <- window(train.ts, start = c(1991, 1), end = c(1991, 24)) 
Acf(ridership.24.ts, lag.max = 12, main = "")
# We can also look at the autocorrelation of the residuals
# For example, we calculate the autocorrelation of the residuals after fitting for season and trend
Acf(train.lm.trend.season$residuals, lag.max = 12, main="")
#Let us also display partial autocorrelation
Pacf(train.lm.trend.season$residuals, lag.max = 12, main="")
```
```{r}
# fit linear regression with quadratic trend and seasonality to Ridership 
train.lm.trend.season <- tslm(train.ts ~ trend + I(trend^2) + season) 
# fit AR(1) model to training residuals 
# use Arima() in the forecast package to fit an ARIMA model # (that includes AR models); order = c(1,0,0) gives an AR(1). 
train.res.arima <- Arima(train.lm.trend.season$residuals, order = c(1,0,0)) 
valid.res.arima.pred <- forecast(train.res.arima, h = 1) 
#Output > 
summary(train.res.arima)
```

Thus, our AR(1) model is 
Et = 0.3728 + 0.5998 * E(t-1) + epsilon

To now forecast residual for April 2001, we plug in the residual from the most recent residual from March 2001 (12.108) into the AR(1) model, this gives

0.3728 + 0.5998 * (12.108 - 0.3728)

The answer is 7.411. We can get this directly using the forecast() function
```{r}
valid.res.arima.pred
```

The positive value indicates that the regression will produce a forecasted value for April 2001 that is too low, and that we should add 7411 riders to the forecasted value. In this particular example, the regression model (with quadratic trend and seasonality) produced a forecast of 2,004,271 riders, and the improved two-stage model [regression + AR(1) correction] corrected it by increasing it to 2,011,906 riders. The actual value for April 2001 turned out to be 2,023,792 riders—much closer to the improved forecast.
